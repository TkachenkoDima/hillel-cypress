# Hillel Cypress Testing Framework

Welcome to the Hillel Cypress Testing Framework! This project leverages the power of Cypress to provide end-to-end testing solutions for modern web applications.

## What is Cypress?

Cypress is a next-generation front-end testing tool built for the modern web. It aims to address the key pain points developers and QA engineers face when testing web applications, including:

- **Fast and Reliable**: Cypress executes tests in the same run loop as your application, ensuring fast and reliable test execution.
- **Real-Time Reloads**: Automatically reloads your tests as you make changes, providing instant feedback.
- **Debuggability**: Offers powerful debugging capabilities with detailed error messages and stack traces.
- **Automatic Waiting**: Automatically waits for commands and assertions before moving on, eliminating the need for manual waits or sleeps.

## Features

- **Time Travel**: Cypress takes snapshots as your tests run, allowing you to hover over each command in the Command Log to see exactly what happened at each step.
- **Stubbing and Spying**: Easily stub and spy on network requests to test edge cases without relying on external services.
- **Consistent Results**: Cypress runs in the same environment as your application, ensuring consistent test results across different environments.

## Getting Started

To get started with Cypress in this project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Cypress**: Run `npm install cypress --save-dev` to add Cypress to your project.
2. **Open Cypress**: Run `npx cypress open` to open the Cypress Test Runner.
3. **Write Tests**: Create test files in the `cypress/integration` directory.
4. **Run Tests**: Use the Cypress Test Runner to execute your tests and view the results.

## Example Test

Here is a simple example of a Cypress test:

```javascript
describe('My First Test', () => {
    it('Visits the Kitchen Sink', () => {
        cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io');
        cy.contains('type').click();
        cy.url().should('include', '/commands/actions');
        cy.get('.action-email').type('fake@email.com').should('have.value', 'fake@email.com');
    });
});
```

## Conclusion

The Hillel Cypress Testing Framework is designed to make end-to-end testing easier and more efficient. With Cypress, you can write reliable and maintainable tests that provide valuable feedback on the quality of your web applications.

Happy Testing!
